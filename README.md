owlapi-gwt
==========

owlapi-gwt is a Google Web Toolkit (GWT) module for working with OWL API object in GWT (both client and server side).
A large subset of the API is supported, which includes entities, class expressions and axioms.  These kinds of objects
can be used on the client side and sent over the wire using the GWT serialization mechanism.
